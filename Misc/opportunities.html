        In the information age, everyone may be the perpetrator or victim of cyberbullying.
        From the combination of pictures and texts, the uglification of malicious pictures, to the launching of naval forces to spread spammers and instigate mass attacks, and even the use of human flesh search without a bottom line, cyberbullying is constantly escalating.
        Therefore, tragedies caused by cyberbullying continue to occur and caused widespread concern. Some daily people and things may inexplicably irritate a group of onlookers, and there are no rules to follow; the pits in cyberspace are beyond common sense again and again, and no one can predict where the borders of network law will be.
        The victim has a name and a surname. However, no specific person can be found who committed the harm. Because of this, the participating netizens act arbitrarily with the mentality that the law does not blame the public. The frequent occurrence of cyberbullying incidents severely harmed the physical and mental health of the parties concerned and even exceeded the legal bottom line.
        Cyberbullying has become one of the means for some netizens to carry out targeted attacks and retaliation. Public figures represented by Cui Xueli have been living under the spotlight and cameras for a long time, and their daily lives have been under the pressure of public opinion. Any of their actions or comments can arouse the onlookers of netizens.
        Whenever something is wrong, a group of people will use this as a breakthrough point to launch a group attack.
    </p>
    </ul><p>
        In addition, to seize opportunities in market competition, some online platforms also deliberately self-direct and perform related incidents in business operations or allow online brutality to spread.
        As a means of unfair competition, the upgraded version of new online violence is increasingly showing signs of organization, profit-making, industrialization, and scale.
        They use online violence to create public opinion, induce or even kidnap relevant departments to adopt favorable responses measures.
        If the cost of propaganda of personal words is low and there is no need to be responsible for irrational emotions, cyberspace will be full of hostility, and everyone may become the next target of violence.
    </p>
    </ul><p>
        One of the important things is regardless of age the victims or perpetrators of cyberbullying may be children or adults. Among 12 to15-year-olds, one in eight children said they were bullied by social media (Children and Parents, 2017).
        Therefore, parents need to protect their children well. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child provides a strong international legal framework for preventing and responding to bullying.
        The government can improve education measures and build safe campuses.
        As an important body responsible for protecting the healthy growth of minors, schools can incorporate content to prevent and respond to school bullying and cyberbullying in curricula and campus activities, so that children and young people can recognize the dangers of bullying, and teach students not to bully others and to prevent and respond to bullying and know how to deal with bullying and cyberbullying problems.
    </p>
    </ul><p>
        Cyberspace should be full of human touch, and it needs to be an orderly space under the rule of law which requires the joint efforts of many parties.
        The first is to promote the rational participation of netizens in the cultivation of online ethics.
        Netizens should jump out of the predicament of group extremes, use rationality and logic to measure network incidents and avoid blindness and conformity.
        The age group (2016) shows social media users are mostly between the ages of 16-39 and young people account for the majority of netizens.
        They have little experience and are prone to impulsiveness. They do not have sufficient ability to identify and think rationally about network information.
        Moral cultivation and legal awareness still need to be further improved.
        Therefore, attention should be paid to the education and guidance of the younger generation of netizens in particular. The second is to improve laws and regulations governing cyber violence and promote cybersecurity legislation.
        The Harmful Digital Communications Act sets out 10 principles that apply to texts, emails and online posts. The Act calls “digital communications”. As a cyberbullying complaint agency, Netsafe should consider these principles when considering complaints.
        However, with the development of online media, there is no law specifically targeting online violence supervision and personal protection. This road has a long way to go. Finally, the media needs to conduct objective public opinion guidance and information check.
        Social media is full of provocative and encouraging information. The emotionalization of the masses on the Internet means that the masses are always facing the risk of being controlled. Traditional media, as the leader of public opinion, has the authority that social media cannot match.
        If the traditional media is absent at this time, it will cause the extreme phenomenon of the Internet community to intensify.
        As the disseminators of social information, media with more discourse power need to shoulder the responsibilities of gatekeepers, provide timely and effective real information to the masses, and maintain the authenticity and reliability of the network.
